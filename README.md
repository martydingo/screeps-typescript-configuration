# Screeps Typescript

This repository is a repository of screeps code, organised into their respective branches. 

You'll find the live code here on the production branch, where it can be noted that there are no commits directly into this branch, other then this README. 

This repository is used in conjuction with `Coder`, `Terraform` and `Kubernetes`, with each branch corresponding to the name of each different development instance created by `Coder`.

With a bit of luck, this allows seperation between development, beta, and production environments, with clear lines of isolation, and allowing multiple, differing instances within each environment.
